/*
  A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located
  at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog
  always jumps a fixed distance, D.

  Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

  Write a function:

  class Solution { public int solution(int X, int Y, int D); }

  that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps
  from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

  For example, given:
  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30

  the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

  after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
  after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
  after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

  Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
  X â‰¤ Y.
